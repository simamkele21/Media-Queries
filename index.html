      my best, but it wasn't good enough'
    </h1>

    <p>
      Deontay Wilder is once again heading back to the drawing board. The former
      heavyweight champion lost for a second time to Tyson Fury on Saturday
      night in Las Vegas when the "Gypsy King" stopped him via 11th-round
      knockout.

      Wilder (42-2-1, 41 KOs) won the opportunity to challenge Fury for a third
      when an arbitrator granted him his rematch following the February 2020
      knockout loss. After nearly 20 months of training, bulking up and solely
      focusing on Fury, Wilder nearly stopped him in the fourth round with a
      pair of knockdowns. But Fury managed to get back to his feet and continued
      to outbox him from the outside before scoring another knockdown in Round
      10 and the seminal blow in Round 11.

      Wilder did not speak with the media following the loss, but released a
      brief statement in the post-fight press release. "I did my best, but it
      wasn't good enough," Wilder said. "I'm not sure what happened. I know that
      in training he did certain things, and I also knew that he didn't come in
      at 277 to be a ballet dancer. He came to lean on me, try to rough me up,
      and he succeeded."
